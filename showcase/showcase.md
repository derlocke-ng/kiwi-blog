### Color Theory in Practice
- **Complementary Colors**: Using opposing colors for visual impact
- **Monochromatic Schemes**: Single-color variations for harmony
- **Triadic Combinations**: Three evenly-spaced colors for balance

### Composition Guidelines
- **Rule of Thirds**: Positioning subjects along imaginary grid lines
- **Leading Lines**: Directing viewer attention through the frame
- **Negative Space**: Using empty areas to enhance the main subject
